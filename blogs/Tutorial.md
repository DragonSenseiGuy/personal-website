# How to use this website

First, for the people who use and love macOS(like myself), you might recognize the similarity. For all the other Windows and Linux users this is going to be a bit different.

Ok let's get started!

## Opening Apps
Just like how you came here, a simple click will take you into each app.

## Closing, Minimising and Fullscreening Apps
A simple click on the red, yellow, green circles on the top bar will close, minimise, and fullscreen the app.

# Resizing windows
You can resize windows by finding a black square at the bottom left corner of every window and dragging it.

And Just like that you are all set! If you find any bugs/weird issues you can always open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dragonsenseiguy/personal-website/issues).
